# Template for tools that use ProB 2.0

This template can be used to build new tools that use ProB 2.0 as a library.
It uses gradle (http://www.gradle.org/) as its build tool, but it can also be adapted to use Maven, Ant+Ivy or any other build tool that supports dependency resolution for Maven artifacts.  

To run the example use: gradle run

If you don't have gradle installed, you can use ./gradlew run

Note: This is only to try it out. Typically you will use the build task to produce a jar file.

# ProB 2.0 source code
